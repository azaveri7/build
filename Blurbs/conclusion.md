If you have made it this far through *Hands-on Scala*, you should by now be
comfortable using the Scala programming language in a wide range of scenarios.
You've implemented algorithms, API clients, web servers, file synchronizers, and
programming languages. You've dealt with concurrency and parallelism. You've
worked with the filesystem, databases, data serialization, and many other
cross-cutting concerns that you would find in any real-world software system.

This book only walks you through a narrow slice of the Scala ecosystem: there is
a wealth of libraries and frameworks that people use writing Scala in
production, and it is impossible to cover them all in one book. Nevertheless,
the core concepts you learned here apply regardless of which specific toolset
you end up using. Breadth-first search is breadth-first search, and a HTTP
request is a HTTP request, regardless of how the exact method calls are spelled.

Scala is a flexible, broadly useful programming language. By now you have seen
how Scala can be used to tackle even difficult, complex problems in an elegant
and straightforward manner. While this book is not the final word in learning
Scala, it should be enough for you to take off on your own, and get started
solving real problems and delivering real value using the Scala language.
