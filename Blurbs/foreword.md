Scala as a language delegates much to libraries. Instead of many primitive
concepts and types it offers a few powerful abstractions that let libraries
define flexible interfaces that are natural to use.

Haoyi's Scala libraries are a beautiful example of what can be built on top of
these foundations. There's a whole universe he covers in this book: libraries
for interacting with the operating system, testing, serialization, parsing,
web-services to a full-featured REPL and build tool. A common thread of all
these libraries is that they are simple and user-friendly.

*Hands-On Scala* is a great resource for learning how to use Scala. It covers a
lot of ground with over a hundred mini-applications using Haoyi's Scala
libraries in a straightforward way. Its code-first philosophy gets to the point
quickly with minimal fuss, with code that is simple and easy to understand.

Making things simple is not easy. It requires restraint, thought, and expertise.
Haoyi has laid out his approach in an illuminating blog post titled *Strategic
Scala Style: The Principle of Least Power*, arguing that less power means more
predictable code, faster understanding and easier maintenance for developers. I
see *Hands-On Scala* as the *Principle of Least Power* in action: it shows that
one can build powerful applications without needing complex frameworks.

The *Principle of Least Power* is what makes Haoyi's Scala code so easy to
understand and his libraries so easy to use. *Hands-On Scala* is the best way to
learn about writing Scala in this simple and straightforward manner, and a great
resource for getting things done using the Scala ecosystem.
