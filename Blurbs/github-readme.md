  self-contained executable programs for the topics being presented in each
  chapter.

## Executable Code Examples

The executable code examples from *Hands-on Scala* are freely available online,
and open source under an MIT license. These examples are meant to be useful to
anyone who is interested in learning Scala, whether or not they are working
through [*Hands-on Scala Programming*](https://handsonscala.com/), though
following along with the book will give you the best experience and help you get
the most out of them.

Each example is:

- **Self-contained**: to be run either using the
  [Ammonite script runner](http://ammonite.io/) or [Mill build
  tool](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/), with no other setup

- **Tested**: with simple test suites provided and instructions on how to run each
  example in that folder's `readme.md` file

- **Executable**: you can download the folder and run the example yourself to
  see it in action

Many of the examples are related, with only small code changes between them to
illustrate a new feature or technique. The `readme.md` file of such downstream
examples will show a diff from the upstream example that it was based upon, so
you can focus your attention on the important code changes that are happening,
with a link back up to the upstream example.

The executable code examples below are organized by each part and each chapter
of the book.
