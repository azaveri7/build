The second part of this book explores the core tools and techniques necessary
for writing Scala applications that run on a single computer. We will cover
algorithms, files and subprocess management, data serialization, scripts and
build pipelines. This chapter builds towards a capstone project where we write
an efficient incremental static site generator using the Scala language.
