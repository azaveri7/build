The fourth and last part of this book explores different ways of structuring
your Scala application to tackle real-world problems. This chapter builds
towards another two capstone projects: building a real-time file synchronizer
and building a programming-language interpreter. These projects will give you a
glimpse of the very different ways the Scala language can be used to implement
challenging applications in an elegant and intuitive manner.
