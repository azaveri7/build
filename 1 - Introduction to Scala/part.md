The first part of this book is a self-contained introduction to the Scala
language. We assume that you have some background programming before, and aim to
help translate your existing knowledge and apply it to Scala. You will come out
of this familiar with the Scala language itself, ready to begin using it in a
wide variety of interesting use cases.
