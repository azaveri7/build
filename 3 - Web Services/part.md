The third part of this book covers using Scala in a world of servers and
clients, systems and services. We will explore using Scala both as a client and
as a server, exchanging HTML and JSON over HTTP or Websockets. This part builds
towards two capstone projects: a parallel web crawler and an interactive chat
website, each representing common use cases you are likely to encounter using
Scala in a networked, distributed environment.
